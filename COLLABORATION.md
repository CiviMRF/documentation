# Collaboration

Join us in the july sprint. 

## What needs to be done

In order of importance.

1. The acronym needs to mean something.....
2. The drupal module needs an admin gui for configuring the connection
3. Documenting use cases (e.g. how this module is used and how it was configured)
4. Implement cron job to process the queue with retry possibility
5. Implement cron job to delete stale cache entries (also integrate this with clear cache)
6. Add autoloaders to the module so classes are automaticly loaded
7. Implement callback functionality
8. Integrate with the Drupal module: CiviCRM Entity
9. Implement composer on the core so you can easisly build it

## Thoughts

It could be cool if CiviMRF could become some kind of Software Development Kit (SDK) for developers who want to connect their application to CiviCRM. Like facebook who also has an SDK which developers could use to connect to facebook and use the facebook api.
